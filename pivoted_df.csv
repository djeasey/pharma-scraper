AMINOGLYCOSIDES – GENTAMICIN,"IM or IV. There are very poorly absorbed PO, everything just ends up in the poo.",,,They are very polar drugs and do not enter cells readily. Gentamicin is largely excluded from the CNS and eye.,,"Renal
Rate of excretion is directly related to creatinine clearance and therefore gentamicin levels should be measured/renal function should be monitored.",,, ,"Aminoglycosides are bactericidal drugs that function by binding irreversibly to the 30S subunit of the ribosome and inhibit protein synthesis.
Firstly, the drug enters the cell by diffusing across the membrane. Secondly, it is actively transported across the cell membrane into the cytoplasm by an oxygen dependent process. Transport is coupled to a proton pump. This means that low ECF pH (forces the bacterial proton pump to work against a concentration gradient) and anaerobic conditions (low oxygen levels) make aminoglycosides less effective.
Aminoglycosides are very effective against aerobic Gram-ve bacteria, e.g. E.coli, Proteus, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia and other Gram-ve rods.
Importantly, aminoglycosides demonstrate synergistic activity with other cell wall inhibiting drugs (penicillins, vancomycin). Using a β-lactam antibiotic together with gentamicin will extend its spectrum to include Gram +ve bacteria.
Therefore, clinical indications are as follows:
Gram-ve sepsis (may be helpful as a second agent due to synergism)
It is not helpful in the following situations:
Pneumonia/lung abscess (decreased oxygen tension in the infected lung, and the infected tissue has lower pH)
Staph/strep infections as a single agent (due to inability to penetrate the cell wall)
Resistance is usually plasmid mediated, and has the following mechanisms:
Production of transferase enzyme that inactivates aminoglycosides
Reduced entry of aminoglycoside into the cell
Alteration of ribosomal binding site
Aminoglycosides have interesting properties that may make single injection preferable to two or three divided doses. They are:
Concentration dependent killing – increased concentration will kill increased proportion of bacteria at an increased rate.
Significant post-antibiotic effect – antibacterial activity persists beyond the time by which measurable drug is present. This may last several hours.
Also note that toxicity is both time and concentration dependent. Toxicity is unlikely to occur unless a certain threshold concentration has been reached. Hence, at therapeutic concentrations, the time above the threshold is less with single doses than with multiple ones.
Other benefits include lower nursing cost and allowing outpatient treatment.",, ,, ,"All aminoglycosides are ototoxic and nephrotoxic.
The ototoxicity usually manifests as tinnitus and high frequency hearing loss initially, then vestibular damage (ataxia and vertigo)
Note that ototoxicity of gentamicin is irreversible and mainly manifests as vestibular dysfunction.
Nephrotoxicity is usually mild and reversible.
Toxicity is potentiated by high drug concentration, longer duration of use, elderly and renal insufficiency.
Avoid the use of gentamicin with loop diuretics (e.g. frusemide or ethacrynic acid, as they are ototoxic) and with other nephrotoxics (e.g. vancomycin and amphotericin)",

Used in the third cycle of shockable ACLS rhythm.","Amiodarone is a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor. Therefore
It increases the effect of digoxin, warfarin and statins.
Because it is cleared by hepatic CYP system, other inhibitors, e.g. cimetidine will increase its effect. Also, inducers, e.g. rifampicin, will reduce its effect.
Because it is an anti-arrhythmic, it potentiates other anti-arrhythmics, e.g. procainamide, phenytoin, quinidine and flecanide.",Amiodarone is hepatically metabolized to desethylamiodarone. This metabolite is bioactive.,"Prolongs the APD and therefore, the QT interval mainly by K+ channel blockade.
Importantly, it has class I, II and class IV activity as well. This broad spectrum of action accounts for its low risk of TdP despite QT prolongation.
Overall, amiodarone’s effects are prolonged AV conduction and decreased automaticity in the Purkinje fibers (β-blockade effect)

Amiodarone also has α-blockade effect, causing vasodilation and hypotension.",,,,Class III anti-arrhythmic,,
AMPHOTERICIN B,,,,,,,,,,"Anti-fungal drug
Interferes with cell membrane function by binding to ergosterol (The predominant sterol of fungi is ergosterol, which is a major component of the fungal lipid cell membrane)

It is useful for life-threatening mycotic infections, and is often used as an initiation agent.
Toxicity can be divided into immediate and long term.
Immediate
Infusion related toxicity, i.e. fevers, chills, vomiting, headache, hypotension and muscle spasms.

At higher doses, aspirin follows zero order kinetics. The T ½ is extended to 15 hours.","(Diagram retrieved from Katzung 12th edition pg. 639)
Aspirin is an irreversible inhibitor of platelet COX (this lasts 8-10 days, which is the lifespan of the platelet as the platelet cannot manufacture new COX).
In other tissues, synthesis of new COX replaces the enzyme so aspirin’s effects on other tissues last 6 to 12 hours.",, , ,Also known as acetylsalicylic acid.,"Acute ingestion of >200mg/kg or chronic over medication will cause toxicity.
The mechanism of toxicity is uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and disruption of normal cellular metabolism.
Signs and symptoms as follows:
CNS: vertigo, tinnitus and loss of hearing.
First sign is respiratory alkalosis and hyperventilation. Metabolic acidosis then occurs (usually HAGMA). ABG will show mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis.
Hyperthermia and vomiting may also occur – contributes to fluid loss and dehydration.
Severe poisoning leads to profound metabolic acidosis, seizures, coma, pulmonary oedema and cardiovascular collapse.

It is antagonized by flumazenil","Refer to the diagram above for benzodiazepine metabolism. The asterisks indicate active metabolites. Note that diazepam is metabolized to desmethymdiazepam, which is active.
Lorazepam has no active metabolite.
Note that hepatic metabolism accounts for clearance of all benzodiazepines.
Most BZDs will undergo phase I reaction, catalyzed by CYP450 systems. The metabolites are then conjugated to form glucuronides and excreted.
However, many phase I metabolites are pharmacologically active, e.g. desmethyldiazepam. This means that the T ½ of diazepam is 40 hours.
Triazolam is metabolized to its α-hydroxy metabolites that do have activity, but they are rapidly conjugated.
Note that the metabolism of diazepam, midazolam and alprazolam may be induced/inhibited by other drugs.
In patients who are elderly and have severe disease, these drugs may have longer elimination half-lives.
In summary, BZDs undergo phase I and phase II reactions in the liver and are excreted by the kidneys. Liver disease affects T ½ but renal disease does not.","Binds to the benzodiazepine site of the GABA-A receptor.
Main function is to increase the efficiency of GABAergic synaptic inhibition.

It is a competitive antagonist of benzodiazepines at the BZD receptor. It also reduces GABA binding. This leads to reduced chloride entry into the cell, and therefore reduced hyperpolarization and increased excitability.
Indications for flumazenil: a) avoid intubation after BZD overdose; b) reversal of BZD after procedural sedation; and c) diagnostic tool.
Adverse effects as follows:
Very short T ½ (duration of action is 1-3 hours) and therefore may need repeated dosing.
Unpredictable effect on antagonism of respiratory depression (that is, giving flumazenil may not reverse respiratory effects of BZDs)

It has a very broad spectrum – covers Gram+ve, Gram-ve, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
Its activity against intracellular organisms is against Rickettsia, but not against Chlamydia.
H.influenzae, Neisseria and bacteroides are all susceptible.
Hence, the indications are as follows:
Treatment of meningitis in patients with penicillin hypersensitivity.
Topically, in eye infections
Serious rickettsial infections, e.g. typhus or Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever

No/very little metabolism occurs at the NMJ.
The offset of action is due to Sux diffusing away from the NMJ.
Onset time is 30-45s (slower in low cardiac output states) and offset time is 8-10 minutes.","Suxemethonium binds to the nicotinic receptor and activates it, causing depolarization of the motor end plate and spreading of the action potential.
However, it is not metabolized by true acetylcholinesterase at the NM junction, and therefore, repolarization cannot occur.
Since muscular contraction requires repetitive firing, a flaccid paralysis then occurs. The initial flaccid paralysis is known as phase I (depolarizing) block, and is further augmented by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.
Prolonged exposure to suxemethonium causes a repolarization of the membrane, but it is not easily depolarized again. The membrane is said to be desensitized (phase II). The channel behaves as if it were blocked by non-depolarising agents and this phase may be reversed with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.
Overall suxemethonium causes a paralysis in ~30s, affecting the arm, neck and leg muscles first before respiratory muscles.
CVS effects of suxemethonium
Suxemethonium stimulates nicotinic receptors at the sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia, as well as muscarinic receptors in the heart. This leads to negative inotropy and negative chronotropy. Administration of an anti-cholinergic medication concurrently may reduce the response.

 ","Electrolytes
Hyperkalemia – hyperkalemia inhibits digoxin binding to the Na/K ATP-ase. Hyperkalemia itself also reduces cardiac automaticity. Therefore, moderate hyperkalemia will reduce the toxicity of digoxin.
Hypercalcaemia – potentiates digoxin toxicity by increasing the intracellular Ca2+ stores, producing automaticity.
Hypermagnesemia – opposite effect to hypercalcaemia.
Drugs that increase digoxin effect
Amiodarone (by increasing plasma digoxin concentrate), diltiazem, verapamil, quinidine, macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin, erythromycin and clarithromycin), K+ depleting drugs (including diuretics), spironolactone and propafenone.
Drugs that decrease digoxin effect
Kaolin pectin, rifampicin (by increasing metabolism) and sulfasalazine (by decreasing GI absorption)
 ",Less than 20% is metabolized.,"It is an inhibitor of Na+/K+ ATP-ase.
Therefore – this increases intracellular Na+ and decreased intracellular K+.
Because of increased intracellular Na+, there is reduced Na/Ca exchanger activity and therefore, there is an increase in intracellular calcium.
This increase in intracellular Ca2+ causes an increase in contractility.
Electrical effects
At higher concentrations of digitalis, a relative extracellular hyperkalemia and intracellular hypercalcaemia occurs.
This leads to increased automaticity of the heart muscle (easier for the myocyte to reach threshold potential). Therefore, there are patterns of bigeminy, followed by VT and then VF.
Parasympathetic and sympathetic effects
At lower doses, digoxin has parasympathetic effects: early signs of toxicity are bradycardia and AV block. At higher doses of toxicity, there is an increased sympathetic effect which may further sensitize the myocardium to automaticity.

Additive effects with other CNS depressants.","Metabolism follows zero order kinetics
~7-10mg/hour typically metabolized by average adult.
Ethanol is metabolized to acetaldehyde via two major pathways:
Alcohol dehydrogenase pathway
Alcohol dehydrogenase found mainly in liver, but small amounts can be found in the brain and stomach.
Alcohol is converted by alcohol dehydrogenase to acetaldehyde. NAD+ acts as a co-factor, and is converted to NADH.
Note that in acute toxicity, NADH will accumulate and cause lactic acidosis and hypoglycaemia.
Microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS)
MEOS uses CYP450 enzymes and NADPH as a co-factor.
It is inducible (and therefore ethanol may induce the metabolism of other drugs)
The acetaldehyde is then converted to acetate, which is broken down to CO2 and H2O. The enzyme metabolizing this reaction is aldehyde dehydrogenase.
Note that aldehyde dehydrogenase (and not alcohol dehydrogenase) is inhibited by disulfiram and other drugs (e.g. metronidazole and trimethoprim)","In CNS, ethanol affects many different receptors
Increased GABA activity at the GABA-A receptor

Moxifloxacin is the exception – it is hepatically metabolized, and dose should be reduced in hepatic failure (not renal failure)","Functions by blocking DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.
This prevents normal DNA transcription and replication.
Note that fluroquinolones were developed to have good Gram+ve and Gram-ve cover. They can be divided into three groups based on activity
Group 1 – norfloxacin. It is the least active of all fluroquinolones against Gram-ve and Gram+ve bacteria.
Group 2 – ciprofloxacin, which has excellent Gram-ve cover and moderate to good Gram+ve cover.
Effective against Enterobacter, Neisseria, Pseudomonas, Campylobacter and Haemophilus.
In particular, ciprofloxacin has the most effective Gram-ve cover.
It is effective against MSSA but not MRSA.
It has limited efficacy against strep and enterococcus.
Group 3 – moxifloxacin, which has excellent Gram-ve cover and good Gram+ve cover, having activity against staph and strep.
Overall, fluroquinolones do have coverage against atypical pneumonia agents (Chlamydia, legionella and mycoplasma) and against mycobacterium.
Hence, indications are as follows:
UTI – because all fluroquinolones (except moxi) achieve good levels in urine.
Bacterial diarrhea (salmonella, shigella)
Intra-abdominal infections
Respiratory infections
May be used to treat chlamydial infections.
Note that high level resistance to one fluroquinolone will generally confer resistance to all other members of this class. Resistance is due to:

Denitrited by glutathione-S-transferase
Nitric oxide is then released. NO activates cGMP and reduces intracellular Ca2+.
This leads to vasodilation.
Organ system effects

Has synergistic effect with gentamicin and therefore can treat enterococcus effectively.
Can also cross the BBB.
Based on properties above, the indications are as follows:
MRSA
Treatment of penicillin-resistant pneumococcal meningitis (in combination with ceftriaxone, cefotaxime or rifampicin)
Given orally to treat C.difficile.",,,,Glycopeptide antibiotic,,
H2 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST,,,,,,,,,,"Remember that the parietal cell has receptors for gastrin, histamine and ACh. Gastrin is released from the antral G-cells into the blood. This causes an increase in cytosolic Ca2+, which stimulates acid secretion from the H/K ATPase (the proton pump) on the canalicular surface.
The H2 receptor antagonists are competitive antagonists of the H2 receptor. They are highly selective and do not affect H1 or H3 receptors.
When given in usual doses, they inhibit 60-70% of 24 hour gastric secretion.
Indications as follows:
GORD
Peptic ulcer disease
Gastritis.
Adverse effects (with regards to cimetidine)
Cimetidine inhibits binding of dihydrotestosterone to androgen receptors. This inhibits metabolism of estradiol and increases serum prolactin levels. It may cause gynecomastia or impotence in men, and galactorrhea in women.","In particular, cimetidine is a strong inhibitor of hepatic CYP450 pathways.

HIT
This is a systemic hypercoagulable state, occurring in 1-4% of people receiving heparin for a minimum of seven days.
Surgical patients are at greatest risk.
Mortality and morbidity is due to thrombotic events (and not to bleeding). Venous thrombus usually occurs, but can be arterial.
Hence, perform platelet counts – be suspicious if patients on heparin develop new thrombus.
HIT should be treated by stopping heparin and commencing a direct thrombin inhibitor (e.g. dabigatran)
Idiosyncratic reactions
Allergy, alopecia, osteoporosis and mineralocorticoid deficiency.
 ","Patients with a chance of life-threatening bleeding/active bleeding

Measuring factor Xa levels may be helpful", ,"Clotting states –DVT/PE
Post-surgical/in-hospital prophylaxis.", , ,"Heparin binds to endothelial cells and plasma proteins
Its activity depends on the natural anticoagulant antithrombin III.
Antithrombin III inhibits clotting factor proteases, especially thrombin (IIa), IXa and Xa. In the absence of heparin, these reactions are slow, but they are accelerated ~1000x in the presence of heparin.
Active heparin molecules bind to AT III, causing a conformation change in AT III. This exposes its active site, allowing for more rapid interaction with proteases.
Binding of heparin with AT III will increase the degradation of factors IIa and Xa especially.
A side note about LMWH (enoxaparin)
LMWH works by inhibiting Factor Xa (and not factor IIa and IXa).
If LMWH is used weight based, it has predictable pharmacokinetics and plasma levels in patients with normal renal function. Therefore, LMWH levels are not commonly measured except in the setting of obesity, renal insufficiency or pregnancy.",,,"Elderly patient
Renal failure",Indirect thrombin inhibitor,"If major bleeding –cease drug. Specific antidote: protamine.
Protamine is a very basic, positive charged ion that binds to the negative charge of heparin and inactivates it (chemical antagonist). The stable heparin-protamine complex has no anti-coagulant activity.
1mg of protamine inactivates 100IU of heparin. Important to avoid excess protamine – itself acts as an anti-coagulant.", 
HISTAMINE,,,,,,,,,,"Its mechanism of action is to exert its influence by binding to histamine receptors, which are all GPCR. They may increase intracellular cAMP or intracellular Ca2+.

Causes vasodilation and increased permeability of vessels.
Chemoattractant for WBCs and neutrophils.
Histamine inhibits the release of lysosome contents, and inhibits some T- and B-cell function.
CVS effects
Vasodilation (leading to warmth/flushing/headache)
Oedema (due to increased capillary permeability)
Hypotension, and reflex increase in chronotropy
Histamine has direct inotropic effects on the heart too.

Most histamine is sequestered and bound in granules in mast cells and basophils.
Non mast cell histamine may be found in the brain, where it acts as a neurotransmitter. It is also found in the enterochromaffin-like cell (ECL cells) in gastric mucosa.
Release of histamine
Mast cells and basophils release histamine of IgE binds to their surface.
Complement may also bind to mast cells, releasing histamine.
It is possible for drugs (e.g. morphine) to release histamine.

Alzheimer’s disease (donepezil, rivastigmine)",,,"These drugs inhibit acetylcholinesterase and bytyrylcholinesterase, leading to increased acetylcholine at cholinoreceptors.
Quaternary alcohols (e.g. erdrophonium) bind electrostatically to ACh-ase. Their action is short-lived (2-10 minutes) due to the lack of covalent bonds.
Carbamate esters (e.g. neostigmine) have one covalent bond. The hydrolysis process takes correspondingly longer (30 minutes to 6 hours)
The organophosphates will form a covalent bond that is initially already very stable, and can further undergo a second step called “aging” that further stabilizes the bond.
Pralidoxime (a nucleophile) may be effective as an antidote against organophosphate poisoning if given before the aging process. It acts as a “cholinesterase regenerator”.
Organ system effects
CNS
Increased excitability, leading to convulsions, then coma and respiratory arrest.
CVS
Increased parasympathetic transmission – bradycardia (negative inotropy, dromotropy and chronotropy)
Effect on sympathetic ganglia may cause initial hypertension, but toxic doses cause marked bradycardia, reduced cardiac output and hypotension.
Neuromuscular blockade
Fasciculations, fibrillations and a depolarizing blockade (akin to Sux) may occur at toxic doses.

In penetrating eye injuries where suxemethonium is contraindicated,
May be used in ICU setting to prevent shivering when therapeutic hypothermia protocol is being used.",Aminoglycosides (e.g. Gentamicin) will enhance NM blockade,"The duration of neuromuscular blockade is strongly correlated with elimination half-life. The agents all have different mechanisms of metabolism:
Atracurium, in addition to hepatic metabolism, is inactivated by spontaneous breakdown (Hoffmann elimination). The main breakdown product is laudanosine. Laudanosine is slowly metabolized by the liver, has long elimination T ½ (150 minutes) and crosses the BBB. At high levels, it will cause seizures and increase the volatile anesthetic requirement.
Cisatracurium is metabolized via Hoffmann elimination as well, but depends less on hepatic metabolism, produces less laudanosine and has less chance of releasing histamine. These features make it overall a better drug than atracurium.
The steroid drugs, rocuronium and vecuronium undergo hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion. This means their duration of action is shorter (25-30 minutes). They are metabolized to 3-hydroxy, 17-hydroxy or 3, 17-dihydroxy compounds. The 3-hydroxy compounds have longer half-lives and are active metabolites. They may accumulate and cause prolonged paralysis.
Pancuronium is mainly dependent on renal excretion (80% excreted renally). This means it has the longest duration of action (>35 minutes)
[One application of the above is that cisatracurium is used for prolonged paralysis in ICU, and rocuronium and vecuronium are not]","Mechanism of action
Both groups mainly act by competitive antagonism of ACh at the nicotinic receptor.
Note that of all the non-depolarising agents, rocuronium is the least potent, having the fastest onset and fastest offset.
Larger doses will actually allow the drug to enter the pore of the channel, producing a stronger blockade. This reduces the ability of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to antagonize the effects. Larger doses may also interfere with pre-junctional release of ACh.
Specific organ effects
Rocuronium, vecuronium and cisatracurium are the most cardiac stable, with little, if any, CVS side effects.
Tubocurarine and atracurium may cause brief hypotension due to histamine release.

These receptors are all GPCR.
The main cellular effect of opioids is to
Close voltage gated Ca2+ channels in pre-synaptic nerve terminals, therefore reducing transmitter release. Reduced Ca2+ entry leads to reduced glutamate, reduced amino acid levels as well as NA, serotonin and ACh from nociceptive terminals.
Open K+ channels, therefore causing hyperpolarization and inhibiting post-synaptic neurons.

Modulation of neurotransmitter release
In terms of pain modulation, opioids are thought to act on both ascending and descending pathways.
Ascending: may act directly on inflamed tissues, on the dorsal horn and in the thalamus.
Descending: act my activating inhibitory nerves and therefore inhibiting pain transmission. May act on the periaqueductal gray and medulla in order to enhance inhibition to the dorsal horn.
Tolerance and dependence are features of opioid drugs
Frequently administered doses lead to an increase in the dose necessary to produce a similar effect: this is tolerance.
Dependence is defined as a withdrawal syndrome that is seen when drug is ceased/antagonist is applied.
The withdrawal/dependence mechanism may be due to the following:
Upregulation of cAMP system.
Receptor recycling, where the failure to induce endocytosis of the µ receptor is an important concept in dependence (Maintenance of normal receptor sensitivity requires reactivation by recycling)
Note that importantly, tolerance to convulsions, miosis or constipation will not occur.
Organ system effects
CNS
Analgesia
Euphoria
Sedation
Sedation usually manifests as drowsiness and clouding of mentation.
Additive effect with other anxiolytics/sedatives (e.g. BZD). Care should be taken when used.
Elderly patients are more susceptible to opioid sedation.
Sedation is thought to be more marked with morphine than with fentanyl/pethidine.
CVS
May cause bradycardia
Hypotension may result if the CVS system is already under stress. This is probably due to vasodilation secondary to histamine release. Therefore, take care in the hypovolemic patient.
Remember that opioids will increase PaCO2 à cerebral vasodilation à RICP.
Respiratory
Significant respiratory depression is seen, mainly by depressing the medullary sensitivity to CO2. There is a rise in PaCO2.
This respiratory depression is poorly tolerated in those with limited reserve, namely severe COPD, Cor Pulmonale, severe asthmatics and RICP.
Cough suppression may occur – lead to airway obstruction/atelectasis.

Paracetamol normally undergoes glucuronidation and sulfation.

Probenecid (A drug that inhibits secretion of weak acids) may be used to prolong half-life.","Hypersensitivity reactions
All penicillins are cross reactive. Allergy is due to the degradation products of penicillin.
Note that a prior history of allergy is quite unreliable.
Rarely, a patient may develop interstitial nephritis, haemolytic anaemia or a vasculitis.
In renal failure, high doses of penicillin may cause seizures.
Nafcillin is associated with neutropenia.
Oxacillin is associated with hepatitis.

The T ½ is 30-60 minutes, but may extend to 10 hours in renal failure. Hence, it is important to adjust the dose.
However, the anti-staph penicillins are cleared by biliary secretion and therefore do not need dose adjustments.
Overall, penicillin clearance is poorer in the newborn.",As above, , ,"They function as cell wall inhibitors by interfering with the transpeptidation reaction of bacterial cell wall synthesis.
Bacterial cell wall is made up of peptidoglycan, whose synthesis is catalysed by the enzyme penicillin binding protein (PBP)
PBP is bound covalently by the β-lactam ring, and thus the bacterial cell wall breaks down and the bacteria dies.
Note that because of its mechanism of action, β-lactamase antibiotics only kill bacteria that are actively dividing and generating cell wall.
Resistance
Four basic mechanisms
Producing β-lactamase (most common)
Modifying the PBP
Impaired penetration of drug to PBP
Drug efflux.
Note that modifying the target PBP is the main mechanism of resistance in MRSA. The PBP has a very low affinity for penicillin, and are only inhibited at high, clinically unachievable concentrations.
Impaired penetration of antibiotic to PBP only occurs in Gram-ve bacteria due to their impermeable outer cell wall membrane.
Efflux pumps may be present in Gram-ve bacteria too.
Clinical indications
Penicillins: streptococci, meningococci, staph (non-β-lactamase producing staph), treponema pallidum and spirochetes (syphilis), clostridium spp., actinomyces and other GPR and non-β-lactamase producing GNB.
Anti-staph penicillins: β-lactamase producing staph (but note that the non-β-lactamase producing staphs and streps are also susceptible). Importantly, enterococci, listeria (GPR) and MRSA are all resistant.
Extended spectrum penicillins
These penicillins have greater Gram-ve cover due to increased ability to penetrate the outer cell membrane.
Amoxycillin/ampicillin is especially useful in treating respiratory tract infections – sinusitis, otitis and LRTIs.
Ticarcillin and piperacillin are effective against GNRs – Klebsiella and Pseudomonas.
Note that usually a penicillin is combined with an aminoglycoside or a fluroquinolone in order to treat Pseudomonas infections.
Penicillins may also be combined with a β-lactamase inhibitor to extend the spectrum to cover β-lactamase producing staph and β-lactamase producing GNB.",, , ,"Penicillins are thiazolidine rings attached to a β-lactam ring.

Organ system effects are as follows:
CVS
Propofol causes the MOST PROFOUND decrease in systemic blood pressure when compared with other induction agents. This is due to profound arteriolar and venodilation, leading to a marked reduction in preload and afterload. Also, there is a strong inhibition of the normal baroreceptor response, so there is only a small increase in HR. *Use carefully in the elderly/already hypovolemic patient*
CNS
Propofol is a hypnotic with no analgesic properties.
It decreases cerebral metabolic rate and cerebral blood flow, therefore reducing ICP and intra-ocular pressure. However, be aware that the reduction in MAP and cerebral blood flow in combination may cause a critical reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure.
Respiratory
Propofol is a potent respiratory depressant.
Decreases both RR and TV (but decreases TV more)
It blunts the respiratory center’s response to hypoxia/hypercapnia
It blunts upper airway reflexes more so than thiopental (good for instrumenting airway/LMA)

Adverse effects
Common side effects are nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
Rare but serious side effects are rhabdomyolysis and drug induced acute interstitial nephritis.
It is theoretically more advantageous to administer PPIs as an infusion than as a bolus because they only inhibit pumps that are actively secreting acid (only a small proportion of pumps are active at a time while the patient is fasting, so administration as an infusion leads to more pumps being inhibited)","Can be administered PO or IV

This causes depolarization and opening of a voltage gated Ca2+ channel, that releases the pre-formed insulin.
Long-term sulfonourea administration causes a reduction in the secretion of glucagon. This causes its hypoglycemic effect.
 
Examples of first generation sulfonoureas are tolbutamide, chlopropamide and tolazamide.
Examples of second generation sulfonoureas are glipizide, glyburide and glimepiride.",,,,Insulin secretagogues,,

In theory, it activates plasminogen that is bound to fibrin, and is supposed to produce local fibrinolysis more so than systemic lysis.",,"A note about the other fibrinolytic drugs:
Streptokinase is a protein (and not an enzyme) synthesized by streptococci that combines with plasminogen and catalyses it to active plasmin.
Urokinase is a human enzyme that is produced by the kidney that converts plasminogen to plasmin.
Tenecteplase has a longer half-life, and therefore can be given as an IV push.
A note about fibrinolytic inhibitors:
Aminocaproic acid (EACA) is a competitive inhibitor of plasminogen activator. It can be administered orally or IV, and usually given as a bolus and then an infusion. It is cleared by the kidney. Tranexamic acid is an analog of EACA, with the same properties.
Clinical indications are haemophilia, bleeding from fibrinolytic therapy, and prophylaxis against re-bleeding from intracranial aneurysms.",,"Fibrinolytic drug –recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Brand names are alteplase, reteplase and tenecteplase.",,
TETRACYCLINES,"PO – the bioavailability approaches 100% for doxycycline.
Absorption is impaired by food and divalent cations (similar property to fluroquinolones)","Hypersensitivity reactions are uncommon. Most of the adverse effects are due to drug effect/alteration of GIT flora.
GIT effects – nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. The alteration of normal GIT/vaginal flora may lead to candidiasis and C.difficile.
Bone effects
May be deposited in teeth/enamel, causing teeth discoloration.
May also cause growth inhibition and deformity.
Hence, avoid in the pregnant population and children <8yrs.
Other reactions are also possible:
Photosensitivity rash
Dizziness and vertigo

Enzyme inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine and fluoxetine) will increase levels, while
Enzyme inducers (e.g. phenobarbital, smoking) will decrease levels.
Note that usage of concurrent sympathomimetic drugs will cause hypertension (Due to decreased uptake of noradrenaline from NET blockade)","Hepatic, by CYP systems
CYP inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine, amiodarone and cimetidine) may prolong its effects.","The main anti-depressant activity is from SERT and NET blockade and therefore increased serotonin and increased noradrenaline concentration at the neuronal synapse. However, these drugs are dirty drugs and have muscarinic blockade, alpha-blockade, histaminergic blockade and sodium channel blockade properties. Note that TCAs do not have dopaminergic blockade and therefore do not cause Parkinsonian symptoms.

Also has other idiosyncratic reactions – N/V, vasculitis and renal damage.",,"Well absorbed and distributes to all body tissue, including the CNS.",,"By renal mechanisms
Dose needs to be reduced in renal impairment.
It is a weak base, and therefore tends to concentrate in urine (which is a weak acid). This property increases its activity in prostatic and vaginal fluids.",,,,"Trimethoprim is a bacteriostatic drug, but it is used synergistically with sulfonamides because they inhibit sequential steps in DNA synthesis. This combination then becomes bactericidal.
Indications as follows:
Oral trimethoprim – treat UTI
Bactrim has a broad spectrum of uses: PCP pneumonia, bacterial diarrhea (treat salmonella and shigella) and UTI/prostatitis.
IV Bactrim is used to treat severe PCP pneumonia.
Pyremethamine/sulfonamides used to treat leishmaniasis/toxoplasmosis
